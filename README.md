Stone In Box
=============

Consider 15 small boxes arranged in a line. 
Each box except one contains a piece of stone. (Thus, there is one empty box. When a game is started the program must choose a box to be the empty one randomly.) 
P layers move in turn. In a move, a player must take aw ay a stone from a box or two stones from two adjace nt boxes. The winner of the game is the player who makes the last move. When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.
